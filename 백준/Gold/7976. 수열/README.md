### 문제 설명

<p>We say that an integer sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> is k-even if the sum of any k consecutive terms of the sequnce is even.</p>

<p>For a given sequence we would like to find out how many of its terms need to be changed so that the sequence becomes k-even.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000). The second line contains a sequence composed of n integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>. For each of the ai’s it holds that 0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1 000 000 000.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output should hold one integer: the minimum number of terms of the sequence that need to be changed so that it becomes k-even.</p>
