### 문제 설명

<p>A bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large honeycomb decides to creep for a walk. In each “step” the larva may move into any of the six adjacent cells and after n steps, it is to end up in its original cell.</p>

<p>Your program has to compute, for a given n, the number of different such larva walks.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line contains an integer giving the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line containing an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 14.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing the number of walks. Under the assumption 1 ≤ n ≤ 14, the answer will be less than 2<sup>31</sup>.</p>
