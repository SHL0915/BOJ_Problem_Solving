### 문제 설명

<p>2*N light bulbs are arranged in two rows and N columns. Each light bulb can be either off or on, and all lights are initially off. </p>

<p>We want to turn some of them on so that they form a beautiful pattern. In one step we can change the state of a sequence of (one or more) consecutive light bulbs in the same row or column. </p>

<p>Given the desired pattern, write a program that finds the minimum number of steps required to form the pattern. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000, the number of columns. </p>

<p>Each of the following two lines contains a sequence of N characters representing the desired final pattern. </p>

<p>Character '1' indicates a light bulb that should be on in the final state, while the character '0' indicates a light bulb that should be off. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output should contain a single integer – the minimum number of steps required. </p>
