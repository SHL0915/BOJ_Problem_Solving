### 문제 설명

<p>During the showdown with Frieza on Namek, Krillin died yet again and needs to be brought back to life using the <em>Dragon Balls</em>. As everybody else is still busy fighting Frieza, the task of retrieving all seven Dragon Balls has fallen to you.</p>

<p>The balls are hidden at unknown locations in a 2D plane and you have been handed a Dragon Radar, designed by Bulma, that you must use to locate them. You can repeatedly fly to arbitrary locations, and the radar will then inform you about the distance to the closest Dragon Ball. If this distance is $0$ this means that you found one of the balls and you can then recalibrate the radar so that it ignores the ball you just found.</p>

<p>With the battle still going on, and the radar having limited energy, you are obviously in a great hurry. You need to make sure to collect all the balls by using the radar no more than $1\,000$ times.</p>
