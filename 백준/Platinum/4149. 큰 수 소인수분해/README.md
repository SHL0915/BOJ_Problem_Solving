### 문제 설명

<p>One of the central ideas behind much cryptography is that factoring large numbers is computationally intensive. In this context one might use a 100 digit number that was a product of two 50 digit prime numbers. Even with the fastest projected computers this factorization will take hundreds of years.</p>

<p>You don't have those computers available, but if you are clever you can still factor fairly large numbers.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input will be single integer values. The numbers (other than the terminator) will be greater than 0 and less than 2<sup>62</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Each positive number from the input must be factored and all factors (other than 1) printed out. The factors must be printed in ascending order, and followed by a single blank line.</p>
